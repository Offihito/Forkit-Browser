## Contributing Guidelines:
We welcome contributions, but please follow these rules to keep the codebase clean and maintainable:
- Write clear, readable, and structured code.
- Add meaningful comments where the logic is non-trivial.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid unstructured or careless coding practices (“vibe coding”).
- Test your changes before submitting them.
- The goal is long-term maintainability, not short-term hacks.
